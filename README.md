# ModComponent Extractor

An application for making and extracting `.modcomponent` files used by [ModComponent](https://github.com/ds5678/ModComponent).

## How To Use

The Program takes exactly one argument.

On Windows, either:
* Drop a modcomponent file onto the exe to extract it into a folder
* Drop a folder onto the exe to compress it into a modcomponent file

On Mac / Linux, either:
* Pass a modcomponent file path as an argument in the terminal to extract it into a folder
* Pass a folder path as an argument in the terminal to compress it into a modcomponent file

If you encounter a popup system error, installing [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) may help. This program might not work on Windows 7.
